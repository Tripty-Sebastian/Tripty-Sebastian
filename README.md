With 18+ years in software development and a recent pivot to Business Intelligence because of my reverence for data, I bring a rare combination of deep technical expertise and analytical acumen. 
My journey has taken me from managing large-scale web applications to transforming raw data into actionable insights that drive smarter business decisions: 
  #   I completed my Bachelor of Engineering from NIT, India. I was recruited on campus to one of the 
       top three software companies before my final year commenced. I have worked on every aspect of 
       Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and have enjoyed Analysis and Design phase the most.
  #   While working, I completed my PGDBA(Finance) owing to my affinity for numbers. Business 
       Intelligence Analysis covers my three passions: numbers, analysis and decision making.
  #   Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve led cross-functional teams, streamlined processes, and significantly cut 
       costsâ€”reducing Vikingâ€™s web-related expenses by 98% in just one year. Iâ€™ve programmed and 
       maintained over 7 eCommerce applications, automated critical workflows, and optimized data 
       quality through SQL. My BI skillset, sharpened through TripleTenâ€™s hands-on program, includes 
       Power BI, Tableau, and end-to-end reporting and dashboarding and visualization.
I thrive on identifying patterns in complex datasets, uncovering insights that improve operations, and presenting clear, concise dashboards to stakeholders across all levels. Whether Iâ€™m coordinating with developers, collaborating with clients, or diving into data models, I bring clarity, structure, and impact.
Now equipped with proficient skills in big data analysis and visualization, I am eager to apply my expertise within the Data industry.
Apart from my professional pursuits, I enjoy Interior Designing, Investing, and Raising my kids. 
Please feel free to connect with me here on LinkedIn or via email at sebastian.tripty@gmail.com. If you happen to know of any BI analyst positions that align with my interests and skills, I would greatly appreciate your recommendations. I'm excited to explore new opportunities and contribute to the success of forward-thinking organizations</p><p align='left'> You can view my resume <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WMgPuBprYx91mpGX_ThF595CcRxtAMoU/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=107234123542012149699&rtpof=true&sd=true ' target=_blank><u>here</u>.</a></p>
